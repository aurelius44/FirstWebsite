                    <p class="para1">An aurora borealis is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in<br>
                        high-latitude regions. Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, <br>
                        spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.

                    <p class="para2">Auroras are the result of disturbances on the magnetosphere caused by solar wind. Major<br>
                        disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass<br>
                        ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetposphereic plasmaa.<br>
                        The particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere. The resulting ionization <br>
                        and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora,<br>
                        occuring within bands arounf both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to <br>
                        the precipitation particles.

                    <h2 class="h2-3">Etymology</h2>

                    <p class="para3">The word "aurora" is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora, who travelled<br>
                        from east to west annoucing the coming of the sun. Ancient Greek poets used the corresponding name Eros<br>
                        metaphorically to refer to the dawn, often mentioning its play of colors across the otherwise dark sky.
